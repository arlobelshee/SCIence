		<h1>Experiments</h1>

		<p>Experiments helps you apply the scientific method to your way of working.</p>

		<p>We do 2 things:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Do what works</li>
			<li>Improve incrementally</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Welcome to the wide world of not knowing what works</h2>

		<p>Working scientifically means accepting that the most intuitive answer provided by the smartest guy is just an opinion. Experience has tremendous value&mdash;provides our starting point&mdash;but can be improved by running
			experiments. Intuition helps us find hypotheses to test. We make changes based only on real world results.</p>

		<p>Our goal is to get a little bit better every day or two. Rather than try for that perfect change that takes a year to execute and may or may not work, we'll collect a lot of small improvements, fix small problems, and lock in small
			advancements.</p>

		<p>It looks like this:</p>

		<figure><img src="img/experiment_timeline.svg" width="100%">
			<figcaption>Experiment time line</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<h2>Maximum improvement; minimum meetings</h2>

		<p>Our goal is to maximize the improvements made. Improvements are made while working, not while in meetings to talk about improvement. Some amount of meeting is necessary overhead. We need to create an experiment definition that we can
			run together, and a meeting is the most efficient way to accomplish that task. The most efficient form of that meeting is the retrospective.</p>

		<p>Our retrospectives:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>have a purpose</strong> (each results in exactly one experiment to run),</li>
			<li><strong>are short</strong> (each has the minimum activities to agree on and define the best experiment to run today),</li>
			<li><strong>are frequent and regular</strong> (so that each experiment can be short and we can build on it, and so that we don't feel we have to solve multiple problems in a single experiment cycle),</li>
			<li><strong>empower the team</strong> (the team decides on a change then makes it; these are not complaint sessions, and the meeting doesn't end in a set of problems or suggestions for someone else to deal with),</li>
			<li><strong>focus on success</strong> (we create a better way of working, not just solve problems or remove obstacles)</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Experiment lifecycle</h2>

		<p>Each experiment progresses as follows.</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Define experiment (40 min)</li>
			<li>Run experiment (2 days)</li>
			<li>Analyze results (10 min)</li>
			<li>Publish</li>
		</ol>

		<p>Steps 1 &amp; 3 happen during retrospectives. Step 4 can be automated using the Experiments tool. Step 2 is where all the value is created.</p>

		<p>Each of these phases involves a series of steps. With all the steps, the full process looks like this.</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Define experiment
				<ol>
					<li>Gather information</li>
					<li>Organize and pick one topic</li>
					<li>Find root causes</li>
					<li>Pick cause(s) to address</li>
					<li>Search for past experimental results</li>
					<li>Generate change ideas</li>
					<li>Pick change to try</li>
					<li>Define measures and time box</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Run experiment
				<ul>
					<li>Work in the new way</li>
					<li>Record data as you go</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Analyze results
				<ol>
					<li>Analyze data</li>
					<li>Propose new experiments or habit change</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Publish
				<ol>
					<li>Share results</li>
					<li>Link to similar experiments; derive theories</li>
					<li>Found in searches</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>The Experiments tool</h2>

		<p>Experiments supports your experimentation process. It does not contain your process. It is not the only tool you will use. In fact, you will use whiteboards, sticky notes, and other physical objects more than you will use
			Experiments. Experiments just does the parts where a computer helps; it leaves everything else to the real-world tools that work better.</p>

		<p>Experiments helps in the following places.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Plan your retrospective</li>
			<li>Take notes</li>
			<li>Make the experiment visible and clear</li>
			<li>Track data</li>
			<li>Publish for other teams</li>
			<li>Get summary info to show your boss that you are experimenting healthily</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Tips for healthy experimentation</h2>

			</div>
			<div class="medium-5 large-4 column panel callout">
				<h3>Just guidance</h3>
				<p>You own your experimentation process. Do whatever you would like. Run experiments on how to experiment. And if you do find something that works better, please publish your experiments so others can
					learn from them.</p>

		</div>

		<ul class="accordion" data-accordion>
			<li class="accordion-navigation">
				<a href="#tips-1">Run 2-day cycles</a>

				<div id="tips-1" class="content">
					<p>Cycles longer than 2 days limit the number of experiments that a team can try. For beginning teams, this means that they can't address enough problems quickly enough. For advanced teams, this means that they can't run enough
						different options when experimenting around a particular problem. In either case, running a larger number of smaller experiments gives better results.</p>

					<p>Most teams worry that the short cycle time will dramatically increase the amount of time spent in retros (overhead). Teams generally find this not to be true. Analyzing what happened and making decisions takes longer when the
						cycle is longer. There is more data to analyze and there is more risk involved in making the wrong decision. The total time spent in meetings tends to be about the same for cycle times of 1 day, 2 days, or 1 week. Cycles longer
						than 1
						week tend to both increase the overhead and decrease the value. Multi-week cycles are usually a bad idea.</p>

					<p>One day cycles can work well, but it is often difficult to define an experiment that gives results in a single day. Habit changes are also easier across at least 2 days. Most teams can define experiments that give data in 2
						days. They can then use the 2-day timebox to check in. They might define a new experiment for the same topic.</p>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="accordion-navigation">
				<a href="#tips-2">Distinguish experiments from habit changes; do both</a>

				<div id="tips-2" class="content">
					<p>Sometimes you already know the correct answer. You don't have to experiment. You already ran the experiment, or you just want to try some result based on some else's experimentation. These situations call for a habit change
						instead of an experiment.</p>

					<dl>
						<dt>Experiment</dt>
						<dd>Temporary change in how you work with the goal of learning. You want to discover the results of one or more potential solutions in a topic area.</dd>
						<dt>Habit change</dt>
						<dd>Permanent change in how you work with the goal of improvement. You have already discovered the way you want to work. Now you just need to develop fluency in this new way of working and make it a team habit.</dd>
					</dl>

					<p>The decision between running an experiment and changing a habit happens during the retrospective, right after researching existing knowledge. The rest of the retrospective will be similar but slightly different for these 2
						options. In either case, you will finish the retrospective with a clear definition of the one thing you are going to do and how to measure it. And in either case, the real point is to support the work that happens between
						retros.</p>


					<p>Beginning teams find that they have a large number of visible problems to address, and there are known-good solutions to these problems available in the literature. They make a lot of habit changes. They tend to use experiments
						only when different team members disagree on which literature solution to use.</p>

					<p>Advanced teams have addressed the obvious problems. They are looking to systematize successes more than to solve problems. They often run into the edge of what is known; there is nothing in the literature for them. They run a
						lot of experiments and publish their results so they can find (and be found by) other teams with similar situations.</p>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="accordion-navigation">
				<a href="#tips-3">Fix problems and systematize successes</a>

				<div id="tips-3" class="content">
					<blockquote>Teams that always spend their retrospectives finding and fixing problems get very good at creating and then fixing problems.</blockquote>
					<p>Our goal is not to fix problems. Our goal is to improve. We need to focus on that improvement, not on the problems.</p>

					<p>Different data-gathering activities will bias an audience towards one or the other of these. Both can come out with any activity, but the proportions will be different. This is one reason why we use different activities each
						time.</p>

					<p>Beginning teams will have a lot of pre-existing problems. They should spend most of their improvement cycles on fixing problems. But they should not spend all of them there, or they will build a find-and-fix habit rather than
						learning how to prevent problems and create a pit of success.</p>

					<p>Teams that have been together and doing regular team-driven improvements for more than 2 months should have addressed all of the obvious, blocking problems. While they should remain vigilent and solve a problem when it arises,
						they should expect to spend 80%+ of their improvement cycles on systematizing successes and creating safety.</p>

				<a href="#tips-4">The team owns its destiny. Not the manager. Not the scrum master. Not any one individual.</a>

				<div id="tips-4" class="content">
					<p>The point of working in an agile fashion is to create a real team, and with it the ability to have actual team-responsibility and team-ownership. But to understand this point, first I have to discuss teams and the ownership of
						work.</p>

					<div class="row">
						<div class="medium-7 medium-push-5 columns panel callout">
							<h3>On teams and accountability</h3>

							<p>Most Americans have only ever seen work groups (which they call teams). A work group is a set of individuals who divide work among themselves (usually having one individual do the task of dividing and assigning the work),
								execute it as individuals, and integrate it to try to solve the original problem. A team is a body that actually shares the execution of the work. It is impossible to identify any chunk of work and say who did it, because
								each
								chunk of work was obviously done by several people in an organic, natural, and messy way.</p>

							<p>The key distinction is that work groups lack identity. If you ask people which team they are on and which people they work with in order to get stuff done, they will give different answers. If you ask people who is on their
								team or who they work with, and then ask those people, and so on, you will eventually get the whole company. You will not find a stable and contained set of people. Because these groups lack identity, they don't really
								exist.
								The "team" can't do anything itself: it can't improve itself, and it can't execute work. Individuals can do both of these things, both for themselves and for other individuals. But the "team" cannot.</p>

							<p>In such an environment, there are two ways work can be owned: it can be individual ownership / accountability, and no ownership / accountability. The most common way to end up with no accountability is to assign something
								to
								the team. Remember, the team doesn't exist, though people often believe that it does. And so people expect the team to do something, but there is no such entity, and the thing doesn't get done.</p>

							<p>This is why Agile methods share the work. Real teams pair program or work in mobs. They contain specializing generalists who don't distinguish the work they do based on their role. The team is flexible and has a number of
								ways
								to collaborate, not just divide and integrate.</p>

							<p>In this environment, there are 3 kinds of ownership: no ownership / accountability, individual ownership / accountability, and team ownership / accountability. It is still possible for something to be not owned and so not
								get
								done. But true team ownership exists. If you give some work chunk to a team (or if they take it themselves), then it gets done. Even if no one can figure out how to do it.</p>

							<p>When it is available, team ownership is the most effective of the three. It can apply a greater number of problem-solving strategies to any problem, has more specialties available, and has lower coordination and
								communication
								costs (teams solve those systematically, so don't have to do as much per instance). Teams are both more flexible and more effective than individuals at doing work.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="medium-5 medium-pull-7 columns">
							<p>Your most important tasks should be done by:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><b>If you work in a work group:</b> an individual. Those are the only entities that actually exist. Pick the individual with the best political acumen for your most important tasks, unless they are so small that they
									only
									require one skill set to execute, in which case you give it to your "best" person at that skill set.
								</li>
								<li><b>If you work in a team:</b> the team. Teams are more effective, more flexible, and learn faster. You will get a cheaper, better result from any team than from any individual in your organization. Use team ownership for
									everything that matters. Use individual ownership only for things that are so unmportant that you don't want to distract your powerhouses. And since these are so unimportant, consider hiring cheap, uneducated labor to
									execute
									them. Quality of result is irrelevant, or you would assign it to a team.
								</li>
							</ul>

							<p>Your ability to improve is one of your most important abilities. Obviously all aspects of improvement should be assigned to a team. The insidious thing is
								that most people have never had team ownership available, so their intuition and experience tell them that this is all bad advice. And it would be, if you were working in a work group.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<p>Here are some ways that people typically screw up and how they could get better results.</p>

					<dl>
						<dt>Error: Use retrospectives to gather information for a manager</dt>
						<dd><p>Managers are individuals too. Deciding how you work is too important a task for an individual. You need the team to own it.</p>

							<p><b>Fix:</b> A good retrospective facilitates the team decision-making process. Focusing the team's attention on making changes and taking action rather than just talking about things naturally pushes the kind of work
								towards what they
								are used to doing (traditionally managers talk about work and individual contributors do work), which makes it easier.</p></dd>
						<dt>Error: Have a scrum master whose job is to remove obstacles</dt>
						<dd><p>Scrum masters are individuals. Removing obstacles is important work, because it often results in greater understanding of the system. This allows insights to make further improvements. These insights need to be available
							to
							the whole team, not just one individual. So the whole team has to own each obstacle and eliminate it together. This also brings a ton more power to obstacle elimination, which lets you eliminate far bigger problems and ensures
							that they stay eliminated.</p>

							<p><b>Fix:</b> Treat obstacles as work, fully equivalent in importance, value, and tracking method as your product work. Track it in the same planning tools. Discuss it as part of the team's objective. Demo your successes and
								discuss your
								failures with stakeholders so that you can try a different approach. Share execution just like you would any other task: by pairing or mobbing.</p>
						</dd>
						<dt>Error: Have a separate body that approves how the group works</dt>
						<dd><p>The problem here is twofold. Secondarily, it leads to decisions made non-locally. Which means they are made without knowledge of the context. Even wise people make poor decisions when they have to average across many
							contexts. More importantly, separating power like this dis-empowers the team. The team loses its free will, and then its identity and cohesiveness fall soon after. Slave teams don't work.</p>

							<p><b>Fix:</b> Let the team make its own decisions. Provide a way that the team can choose to seek information about things that other teams have tried, but don't force it to hear about "best practices" before trying something
								new. Let
								the team make the call&mdash;especially when that call seems "wrong" from the outside. A wrong-seeming call either means the team is about to learn something
								or they are taking into account exactly the kind of context that you can't see from the outside. Either way, changing that decision from outside will de-optimize the team.</p>
						</dd>
						<dt>Error: Have a coordinator (or group) that tries to share ways of working across teams</dt>
						<dd><p>The problems here are bandwidth and data corruption. A central coordinating body is an ineffective communications medium. First, if the communications are human-mediated, then you can only communicate as much information
							as those humans can assimilate, organize, and spread. As the organization grows, the routing problem becomes harder and the amount of information to route becomes larger. Any human intermediary gets swamped. Second, people
							have opinions and knowledge. That's why we employ them. If you use humans as a communication channel between two contexts, the communication will get tainted by the context of the man in the middle&mdash;which reduces the
							value of the information. The endpoint contexts are both relevant. The middle one is not. So don't have any humans involved in the middle.</p>

							<p><b>Fix:</b> Use an automated system to share data between systems. Replace coordinators (often managers) with search. Replace central writers with collaborative editing. Replace human-centric networking with the ability for
								teams to
								follow each other&mdash;and then stop following each other. Replace centralized best practice finders with wiki farmers and reference librarians (both of which facilitate the individual contributors doing the actual
								information sorting).</p></dd>
						<dt>Error: Depend on a person's intuition, insight, or experience in order to decide what to do, rather than running an experiment</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>Insight is great, except that it is wrong a lot. And not obvious when it is. Commonly, good insight from an experienced individual will find an improvement. However, it will miss a much larger improvement that was possible.
								That's because it is based on experience. Experience is great at hill climbing. It is also restricted to hills that it has climbed before. The same attribute that helps you get consistent, small wins will consistently
								prevent you from finding the big wins along the way.</p>

							<p><b>Fix:</b> Good retrospectives involve activities that blend intuition from multiple people. This helps us find more of the possibilities. Further activities then build on these insights to explore the possibilities that
								arise from
								combining and riffing. And a good change process still treats all this as suspect. Nothing matters until it works in the real world. We agree how we will measure success, then we try things and see what succeeds. The change
								process should involve running multiple different experiments in each topic area; they could all be run by one team sequentially, or by multiple teams in parallel. In either case, we want to run lots of options, see the
								results of each, and then pick which set of results we want to attain.</p>
						</dd>
					</dl>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="accordion-navigation">
				<a href="#tips-5">Discuss when you could be doing</a>

				<div id="tips-5" class="content">
					<p>Talking doesn't change things. Action does. The nice thing about short cycles + experimentation is that you don't have to guess the right answer. Once your discussion gets to the point where you've got 2-5 top contenders, stop
						discussing and propose an experiment.</p>

					<p>Agree how you would assess success in your context. Agree on risks (such as externalized costs) that the options may cause, and how you would detect if they did. Then define an experiment
						where you try the various options and see what the results are for each. Decide between them once the data are in.</p>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="accordion-navigation">
				<a href="#tips-6">Your process is your product; do one thing at a time</a>

				<div id="tips-6" class="content">
					<p>Especially at the beginning, it feels like the team is beset with problems. Most of them seem simple, and you expect that one person could take care of them if they just took on the task and put some time into it. Resist that temptation. It is the way the team has done things in the past, and will give the same results now as it always has before. It's what got you here.</p>

					<p>When we try to do multiple things at once, either by assigning them to individuals to do in parallel or by splitting the focus of the group, the group loses its ability to collaborate and to get things done-done. Problems will appear solved,  then recur. The effort is often wasted even if it appears successful. It looks like lots of progress happens at once, but in truth very little changes. Multitaskers can apply band-aid solutions, but they can't solve systemic problems.</p>

					<p>Build your process the same way as you build your product. Focus on one thing at a time and get it done-done. Put the whole team on it. Use every specialty you have. Make sure you will never have to come back to it again. Ship it. Then re-asses and decide the next improvement to make.</p>

					<p>And if you've got a large number of small problems, then just make your iteration smaller. The smaller your iteration, the smaller your iteration planning meeting (retrospectives are iteration planning for process improvement). If you need to maintain long-term cohesiveness and direction while executing a large number of small improvements, use a visualization technique, such as rolling wave planning or legacy code visualization, designed to solve that problem. Some teams with large numbers of very small problems that have known-in-industry answers find 90 minutes to be the right length for their improvement cycle. Most teams will find they need to run experiments for longer than this, but keep them short.</p>
